This repo is based on MARVEL, which is an R & D lab of my University. It provides students oppurtunities to grow in many domains, my domain being Cloud Computing & Cybersecurity.
This repository contains a nnumber of tasks that I have completed successfully and have gained invaluable knowlegdge.

The tasks explore many topics related to Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity like encryption, Nmapping, OSI model, Cloud technologies like AWS lambda, Terraform, Jenkins etc.
I have also included notes that I have made to help me understand all of those stuff better.
