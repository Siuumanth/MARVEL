# TASK 1: AWS Lambda

Since this is my first time getting into Amazon Web Services (AWS), I started my learning the fundamentals of Cloud Computing with AWS before I went ahead with this task. I first learnt about the AWS console, then gained knowledge about core services like EC2 instances, Dynamo DB, S3 buckets, etc. Next I went on to learning serverless computing with AWS lambda.
### **Serverless with AWS**
It sounds like there are no servers, but it just means that you don't have to **manage servers**â€”AWS, GCP or any cloud service will handle them for us. We just write our code normally and it runs **only when it is needed**, responding to events. AWS automatically manages the infrastructure, scaling, and execution of our defined functions in response to triggers.
**FaaS or Function as a Service**  is a part of serverless architecture. It is a way to achieve it, by breaking our apps into small, independent functions, that run only when triggered. We pay only when we use it.
### **AWS Lambda**
It is the **FaaS platform of AWS**. We can define a function, upload it and AWS runs when its triggered. To get started, I followed the AWS' official tutorial on creating a simple "Hello World" function for testing. Next, I went ahead creating the Chat App.

1. `API Gateway`: First, I created an API gateway for Web Sockets Management, for realtime communication. For the route selection expressions, I chose the 3 basic ones which handle:
      - `$connect route`: client connection 
      - `$disconnect route`: disconnection
      -  `$default route`: message sharing
      
2. `Attaching Integrations:` I created 3 lambda functions to manage each of the above routes, and linked them. After these steps, I got the WebSocket URL which I could then integrate with my app.

After this, I created a simple Express JS server, that serves a simple HTML page. I then connected the script with the HTML, which was capable of testing 3 tasks, opening, olosing connection and sending a message, which worked well.

## TASK 2: CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery) - Intro to Jenkins

### CI / CD :
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery**, a practice in software development aimed at automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. 

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that whenever developers make changes to the code, these changes are automatically merged into a shared repository, built, and tested to identify issues early.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release process, pushing changes to production automatically after passing all tests, while **Continuous Delivery** prepares the code for deployment but requires manual approval to push it live. 


## TASK 4: Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp, used to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure efficiently. It allows users to write declarative configuration files specifying the desired state of infrastructure (like servers, networks, and databases), and Terraform handles the deployment and changes.

It supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, as well as on-premises systems, making it a versatile tool for automating and maintaining consistent infrastructure across environments.


## TASK 6: Docker




## TASK 10: NMap

Nmap is a powerful network discovery tool that can be used for :
- IP/Port scanning
- discovery of services
- OS detection, Version detection
- information on targets, including reverse DNS
- identifying device types and MAC addresses.

I first learnt about how SYN scans work, and the various options in the NMAP commands like `-sS , -sP , -A , -Pn , -iL , -6 , -sn , -p and more`. I was facing issues with using NMAP, which I was able to resolve by changing the network settings in Virtual Box from `NAT` to `Bridged Adapter` . I ran NMAP on my network. I was able to identify all the devices that was connected to my network, and also on another website specifically made for pentesting.


I saw resources on how we can find vulnerabilities when we get an NMAP result, identifying the different types of ports, and basics on how we can exploit those vulnerabilities, like SSH or FTP, but I was not able to fully exploit them.
