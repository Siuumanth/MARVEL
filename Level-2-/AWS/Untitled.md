# Food Redistribution Platform - README

## KhanaConnect

## Overview

KhanaConnect is a simple, impactful platform built to tackle food waste by connecting hotels, restaurants, and other kitchens with people and institutions that genuinely need food. Our goal is to create a smarter and more humane way to make sure no meal goes to waste.

## Key Features

### 1. Kitchen Partnership

Kitchens and restaurants can sign up to share their daily surplus food with those in need. To ensure food safety, all kitchens are required to submit their FSSAI code during registration.

### 2. Seekers - Food Consumers

Seekers include government colleges, NGOs, old age homes, and similar institutions. They can register to request leftover food, helping ensure excess food is redirected instead of discarded.

### 3. Real-time Frontend Dashboard

We’ve built a dynamic frontend dashboard that shows live statistics—like the number of kitchens and seekers—and how they’re connected on our platform.

### 4. Interactive Map

A built-in map helps kitchens and seekers find each other based on location. This makes coordination and logistics much easier.

### 5. Volunteer Delivery System

A dedicated page allows volunteers to sign up and help deliver food between kitchens and seekers. This keeps the process smooth and efficient.

### 6. Email Notifications

Our system sends automatic email alerts:

- When a new kitchen registers
    
- When a delivery is scheduled or ready This keeps everyone in the loop—kitchens, seekers, and delivery volunteers.
    

### 7. Smart Matching Algorithm

We use a thoughtful algorithm to prioritize food distribution. It looks at factors like:

- How many times a seeker has received food
    
- How much food they need daily
    
- Proximity to the kitchen This helps us ensure fair, balanced, and efficient distribution.
    

## How It Works

1. **Kitchen Registration**: Kitchens list leftover food and submit their FSSAI code.
    
2. **Seeker Registration**: Institutions sign up to request food.
    
3. **Matching Process**: The system pairs kitchens with seekers based on need and distance.
    
4. **Volunteer Involvement**: Volunteers help with pickup and delivery.
    
5. **Email Alerts**: Automated notifications ensure smooth coordination.
    
6. **Delivery Completion**: Food is delivered where it’s needed—on time and safely.
