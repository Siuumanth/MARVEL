# What is it?
Wireshark is a **network protocol analyzer** used for capturing, inspecting, and analyzing network traffic in real-time. It allows users to see what's happening at a deep level in a network, making it useful for troubleshooting, security analysis, and network optimization.

### **Key Features of Wireshark:**
- **Packet Capture** – Captures live network traffic or analyzes previously saved packet data.
- **Protocol Analysis** – Supports a vast range of network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc.).
- **Filtering & Searching** – Apply powerful display filters to focus on specific traffic.
- **Decryption** – Can decrypt certain encrypted protocols (like SSL/TLS) if keys are available.
- **Graphical & Statistical Tools** – Visualize traffic patterns and trends.
- **Cross-Platform** – Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    

### **Common Use Cases:**
- **Network troubleshooting** – Identify latency, packet loss, or misconfigured devices.
- **Security analysis** – Detect suspicious traffic or potential attacks.
- **Learning networking concepts** – Understand how network protocols work in detail.
